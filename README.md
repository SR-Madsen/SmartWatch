#Smart Watch

This project contains the schematic, PCB, and programming files used for a Smart Watch project.
The project is based on a Nordic nRF52840 microcontroller, communicating with BLE and showing graphics on the low-power screen.
The microcontroller uses the Zephyr RTOS, and connects to a Maxim pulse and blood-oxygen IC, an accelerometer, and a buzzer.
